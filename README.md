# Project 1 - *Flicks*

**Flicks** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## User Stories

- [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [x] User can search for a movie.
- [ ] All images fade in as they are loading.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Learn how to implement bottom bar navigation
2. Learn how to implement a "cleaner way" to deal with errors or actually learn to deal with errors in general.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I did not change the view of the story builder from Iphone 7 to Iphone 5 so for a long time my positioning was way off.
